			<h1>about me.</h1>
			<h2>I am a Computer Science student that just graduated from Carleton University.</h2>
			<p>I am a robot sent to turn coffee into code. When I'm not programming you can find me at my day job as a fashion police. I am still waiting for a worthy opponent to beat me in music trivia (I listen to a lot of music). Programming, tech, photography, graphic Design, cars, music, and drinking many beers are some of 
			my many hobbies. Lets grab a beer, or hit up a concert!  </p>
